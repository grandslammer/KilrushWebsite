<h2 id="pagehead">History of Kilrush</h2>
<h3>Kilrush, The Place-name</h3>

<p>The Parish of Kilrush (Cill Rois) in Co. Wexford takes its name from the ancient church built there many centuries ago and known from its situation as the church of the wood or copse. There is no town land of the name in the parish. It has been said that the original patron saint was St. Colman, but whether this be correct or not, by the thirteenth century the dedication of the parish church was to St. Brigid. This church was situated in the old cemetery where the present Church of Ireland now stands in the town land of Ballynaberney.</p>
  
  
  
<h3>Kilrush, The Catholic Church</h3>
  <p>The first post reformation church for the Roman Catholic community in Kilrush was in Knockaree, in what is now the old cemetery. Local tradition says that the ground was a common before being used for church and school. This church was burned down on march 15th 1799. Fr. Mark Barry P.P. rebuilt it in 1802-1803 and it remained in use until in 1843. Fr. John French P.P. commenced the task of building a permanent church on the same site. He died in the following year and the building was completed by his brother Canon French P.P. before his death in 1854. This church remained in use until replaced by the present structure in 1969.</p>
  
  
  
<h3>Kilrush, 1798</h3>
  <p>Kilrush was one of the areas which suffered greatly in the 1798 Insurrection. There are many records of atrocities committed in the parish before and during 1798. The north Cork Militia based in Carnew and the Newtownbarry Militia forces waged a campaign of terror, burning homes and committing many atrocities in the area from before the general uprising. This continued despite a pledge of loyalty signed by Fr. Aidan Murphy and of his parishioners on 28th February 1798.</p>
  
  
  
<h3>Topography, Kilrush in 1837</h3>
  <p>Descriptions from Lewis's Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, 1837
  
  KILRUSH, a parish, in the barony of Scarawalsh, county of Wexford, and province of Leinster, adjoining the post-town of Newtownbarry, and containing 2731 inhabitants. This parish comprises 11,036 statute acres of land generally fertile; but with the exception of some pebble limestone, manure is scarce, and limestone is brought from the county of Carlow. It is watered by the river Slaney, over which are two stone bridges, one connecting it with Newtownbarry, and the other crossing the river at Clohamon.
  
  The principal seats are Ballynapark, that of G. Browne, Esq.; Clohamon Lodge, of N. Browne, Esq.; Ballyrankin, of Major Devereux; and Newlands, of the Rev. W. Hore, all pleasantly situated on the banks of the Slaney. Part of the demesne of Woodfield, the beautiful seat of Lord Farnham, is also in this parish. Clohamon is a neat and thriving village of recent origin, and the population is chiefly employed in the large flour and cotton-mills of Mr. William Lewis, from the latter of which are produced on an average about 200 pieces weekly.
  
  The living is a rectory, in the diocese of Ferns, forming the corps of the prebend of Kilrush in Ferns cathedral, and in the patronage of the Bishop: the tithes amount to £694. 3. 1. The church is a small plain edifice, and has recently been repaired by a grant of £262 from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners.
  
  In the R. C. divisions it is the head of a union or district, including this parish and that part of Carnew which is in the county of Wexford, and containing chapels at Kilrush and Askamore; the former is a neat modern building; attached to which are a residence for the priest and a school. About 150 children are educated in two public schools, to one of which the rector contributes £10, and to the other Grogan Morgan, Esq., £2, annually.</p>
  
  
  
<h3>Parnell's Cross</h3>
  <p>The land league was founded in 1879 by Michael Davitt and Charles Stewart Parnell was its first president. The following year a branch was established in Bunclody, catering for Kilrush, Kilmyshall, Castledockrell and Marshalstown.
  
  The principal organiser in the district was Gregory Murphy of Ballinaberney who became vice president of the branch. The land league was suppressed by proclamation in 1881, but in 1882 Parnell founded the Irish National League in its place. The Kilrush branch was known as the Parnell's Cross and Clohamon Branch. Through the influence of Gregory Murphy, the cross-roads at Kilrush was named "Parnell's Cross".</p>
